# Currency-Converter-T1
Currency Converting Android Application.

Convert currency value for some selected countries. Input Amount, select base currency and in which currency you want to convert.

Used https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ API for getting exchange rates. Used Call of Retrofit library for HTTP request and collected JsonObject. After that extracted the exchange rate and calculated the result.
Used ArrayAdapter for spinner.
